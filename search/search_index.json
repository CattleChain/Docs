The solution implements a complete monitoring solution for cattle based on IoT wearables, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, FIWARE, Sentinel satellite imagery, and blockchain technologies. In this proposal, we are only designing and developing an architecture for blockchain implementation. In this system, blockchain technology is used to assure full traceability and transparency along the whole supply chain. Data coming from the IoT sensors are directly stored (without human intervention) and made available for traceability and certification purposes, and it is integrated with FIWARE technologies to generate an Open Platform, where consumers and public authorities can consult the information about the meat and dairy supply chain through data market places, management apps, and tracking modules. The system also implements an Blockchain assured Animal Welfare Indicator that ensures that the meat and dairy products comply with the highest animal welfare standards without the need to involve a certification body. The seal granted process relies on the automatic evaluation of the data provided by the IoT devices whose truthfulness is guaranteed by the blockchain. This information is available for public authorities, retailers, and consumers. At the same time, the Animal Welfare Seal increases consumers\u2019 acceptance of products carrying it, increasing companies and farmers\u2019 willingness to use our system.","title":"Home"},{"location":"index.html#cattlechain-40","text":"","title":"Cattlechain 4.0"},{"location":"index.html#introduction","text":"Cattlechain 4.0, a disruptive supply chain solution to increase farm productivity and sustainability while promoting animal welfare, focused on overcoming various EU livestock sector challenges and to democratize the access to smart technologies by livestock.
