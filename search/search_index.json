Figure present the architecture of the CattleChain platform. Generic Enablers A Context Broker Generic Enabler is the core and mandatory component of any \u201cPowered by FIWARE\u201d platform or solution. It enables to manage context information in a highly decentralized and large-scale manner. In the CattleChain Project there are the generic enablers has been used: KeyRock Keyrock is the FIWARE component responsible for Identity Management. Using Keyrock (in conjunction with other security components such as PEP Proxy and Authzforce) enables you to add OAuth2-based authentication and authorization security to your services and applications. The main identity management concepts within Keyrock are: Users: Have a registered account in Keyrock. Can manage organizations and register applications. Organizations: Are group of users that share resources of an application (roles and permissions). Users can be members or owners (manage the organization). Applications: has the client role in the OAuth 2.0 architecture and will request protected user data. Are able to authenticate users using their Oauth credentials (ID and secret) which unequivocally identify the application Define roles and permissions to manage authorization of users and organizations Can register Pep Proxy to protect backends. Can register IoT Agents. Keyrock provides both a GUI and an API interface. to know more about keyrock please follow keyrock documentation . PEP Proxy- Wilma Wilma is a PEP Proxy - it can be combined with other security components such as Keyrock and Authzforce to enforce access control to your backend applications. This means that only permitted users will be able to access your Generic Enablers or REST services. Identity Management allows you to manage specific permissions and policies to resources allowing different access levels for your users. to know more about wilma please follow Wilma documentation . important: to enable the Canis Major integration please use the fork version of PEP Proxy source code can be found in FIWARE-BLOCKCHAIN github Orion-LD (Core) Orion-LD is an alternative NGSI-LD Context Broker written in C/C++. It is a standalone executable and therefore small, fast, lightweight and easy to handle. Context brokers allow for the management and requesting context of information in a structured manner based on linked data standards following the NGSI-LD specification. Orion-LD is more suitable for smaller installations or possibly in embedded environments - it currentlys supports only a subset of the standard NGSI-LD endpoints. Documentation Quantumleap QuantumLeap is a REST service for storing, querying and retrieving NGSI v2 and NGSI-LD (experimental support) spatial-temporal data. QuantumLeap converts NGSI semi-structured data into tabular format and stores it in a time-series database, associating each database record with a time index and, if present in the NGSI data, a location on Earth. REST clients can then retrieve NGSI entities by filtering entity sets through time ranges and spatial operators. Note that, from the client's stand point, these queries are defined on NGSI entities as opposed to database tables. However, the query functionality available through the REST interface is quite basic and most complex queries typically require clients to use the database directly.

Documentation Cosmos ORION-SPARK Connector: The Cosmos Generic Enabler enables easier BigData analysis over context, integrated with some of the most popular BigData platforms. Documentation CanisMajor - Blockchain Adaptor Under Development CanisMajor is a blockchain adaptor that supports various DLTs, the adaptor aims to submit the data to DLT and works with NGSI-LD and NGSI-V2 as well. CanisMajor Adaptor recommend using AEI contract Model for the Ethereum Clients.

To do so we are currenlty using Alastria Network, a non-profit association that promotes the digital economy through the development of decentralised ledger technologies/Blockchain and also a member of FIWARE. Alastria partners have two operational networks (Network T and Network B) on which nodes can be deployed (either regular nodes or critical: validators and bootnodes). The first of Alastria\u2019s partner node networks (Red T) is built on Quorum technology,an open-source Ethereum client developed under the LGPL license and written in Go. GoQuorum is an Ethereum-based protocol that runs private, permissioned networks. To know more about it follow here: Alastria Network Quorum Technology Use of AEI Contract CattleChain project using AEI (Asset, Event, Identity) Standard Contract. AEI Smart Contract is written in Solidity using ERC721 standard (NFT) and can be use with Ethereum Clients. It is compatible with FIWARE-Canis Major Adaptor to store the data in blockchain. AEI, asset, events (metadata), identity, is designed to store the NGSI-LD model with the help of Canis Major Adaptor. ERC 721 Contract is follow OpenZepplin standards, security audits are trusted by leading organizations building decentralized systems. ERC 721 ERC 721 A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, also known as deeds. The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFTs within smart contracts. This standard provides basic functionality to track and transfer NFTs. We considered use cases of NFTs being owned and transacted by individuals as well as consignment to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers (\u201coperators\u201d). NFTs can represent ownership over digital or physical assets. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more: Physical property \u2014 houses, unique artwork Virtual collectables \u2014 unique pictures of kittens, collectable cards \u201cNegative value\u201d assets \u2014 loans, burdens and other responsibilities In general, all houses are distinct and no two kittens are alike. NFTs are distinguishable and you must track the ownership of each one separately. to know more follow here: ERC 721 OpenZepplin ERC721 AEI Contract Design AEI contract is cosist of 3 aspects (see the figure below): Entity/Asset with a unique identity will be a new asset (1:1 mapping of asset to an identity). Event or Metadata of the asset/entity has a 1:n mapping. An Asset can have a 1:n relationship with any other asset. Example To Store the NGSI-LD model there are few possibilities with the help of some supported storage type: IPFS IOTA MaM MerkleRoot Methods - createAsset(bytes32 uuid, string memory _newHash) - getAsset(bytes32 uuid) - updateAsset(bytes32 uuid, string memory _newHash) - removeAsset (bytes32 uuid) - isValidAsset(bytes32 uuid, bytes32[] memory _proof, bytes32 _leaf) - isValidAssetEthMessage(bytes32 uuid, bytes32 _messageHash, bytes memory _signature) - addRelation(bytes32 uuid, bytes32 reluuid) - getRelations(bytes32 uuid) - removeRelation(bytes32 uuid, uint index) - isValidRelation(bytes32 uuid, uint index, bytes32[] memory _proof, bytes32 _leaf) - addMetadata(bytes32 uuid, string memory _metadatahash) - getMetadatas(bytes32 uuid) public view returns (string[] memory) - removeMetadata(bytes32 uuid, uint index) - isValidMetadata(bytes32 uuid, uint index, bytes32[] memory _proof, bytes32 _leaf) Apart from that ERC721, Ownable, MerkleProof, ECDSA methods are supported.
