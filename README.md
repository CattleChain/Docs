# CattleChain 4.0 Documentation

Cattlechain 4.0, a disruptive supply chain solution to increase farm productivity and sustainability while promoting animal welfare, focused on overcoming various EU livestock sector challenges and to democratize the access to smart technologies by livestock. The solution implements a complete monitoring solution for cattle based on IoT wearables, Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, FIWARE, Sentinel satellite imagery, and blockchain technologies. In this proposal, we are only designing and developing an architecture for blockchain implementation.
